            <h3>Usage:</h3>
            <PRE>    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; &lt;command&gt; { /yes } { /byte }
</PRE>
            <h3>Requirements:</h3>
        <P>The program is made for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server

        </P>
        <P>You need administrative privileges to make it work!</P>
        <H3>Commands:</H3>
        <PRE>
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; driveinfo              Display drive information
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; drivesize              Returns drive size in MB as return value
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; listpartitions         Display partition information
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; savembr &lt;file&gt;         Save MBR and partitions to file
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; restorembr &lt;file&gt;      Restore MBR and partitions from file
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; fixmbr                 Update MBR code to W2K/XP/2003
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; clean                  Delete partitions in MBR
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; readsignature {/byte}  Read disk signature from MBR
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; writesignature hex     Write disk signature from MBR
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; generatesignature      Generate disk signature in MBR
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; readstate              Read state from byte 0x1b0 in MBR
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; writestate &lt;state&gt;     Write state to byte 0x1b0 in MBR
    MbrFix volumeinformation driveletter       Get volume information for partition
</PRE>
        <P></P>
        <p>
            Drive numbering &lt;num&gt; starts on 0.</p>
        <p>
            Commands restorembr, fixmbr, generatesignature, writestate and clean will ask 
            for confirmation unless /yes is included.</p>
        <p>
            If the /byte option is given for the readsignature command, the signature is 
            returned as a byte array instead of as a DWORD.</p>
        <H3>Return codes:</H3>
        <P>
            The program reports an errorlevel as 0 for OK and other values for errors.<br>
            The exception to this is the ReadState command which returns the state as a 
            return code as well as printing to stdout. Any errors for this command&nbsp;are 
            returned as negative values because of this. The DriveSize command returns 
            the&nbsp;drive size in MB, and 0 in case of error.
        </P>
        <h3>Why do I need this utility?</h3>
        <P>Well, I was testing Windows Embedded XP using a virtual PC, and was booting 
            Windows PE from a CD-ROM to partition a brand new harddisk (quite cheap, since 
            it was virtual <STRONG><EM>!</EM></STRONG>). Using the diskpart.exe utility 
            (found in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, available as a download for 
            Windows 2000), I created the partition, made it Active, assigned it a drive 
            letter. I then used the format.exe utility to format it to NTFS (format C: 
            /fs:ntfs).</P>
        <pre>
DISKPART&gt; detail part
Partition 1
Type: 07
Hidden: No
Active: Yes

 ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------   ---------  --------
* Volume 1     C    WinXP        NTFS   Partition    149 MB   OK        System            
            </pre>
        <P>I then mounted a network drive to my physical computer and copied the boot.ini, 
            ntldr, ntdetect.com, windows folder, program files folder, etc. from the 
            Windows Embedded XP image directory. Everything to make it boot.</P>
        <P>Well everything should be OK, so I rebooted the (virtual) computer and expected 
            it to boot up Windows Embedded XP.</P>
        <P>But not so! It just sat there with a nice black screen. No error message at all.</P>
        <P>Some investigation later on the Internet, I found this very informative page by 
            Daniel B. Sedory: <A href="http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/asm/mbr/MBR_in_detail.htm">
                http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/asm/mbr/MBR_in_detail.htm</A>, 
            containing a wealth of MBR info. The info on one of the pages states that the 
            MBR code is installed on the drive when the Windows setup program runs and no 
            MBR code exists already. Hmm.., seemed to be&nbsp;right on the mark.</P>
        <P>I searched further on the Internet, but the only utilities I found which could 
            install MBR code was for other operating systems, like FDISK.exe /MBR for DOS 
            (but I wouldn't boot to DOS...) or the fixmbr command in the Windows 
            2000/XP/2003 Recovery Console. Didn't want that either. Wanted something to 
            work on a Windows 32 bit platform, to be able to fix the problem in other cases 
            when using Win PE and just plain copying in the operating system 
            files.&nbsp;So, then I was left to make the utility myself!</P>
        <P>Problem solved: After booting up Windows PE from CD again, the command &nbsp; <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
                <STRONG>MBRFix /drive 0 fixmbr /yes</STRONG></FONT> &nbsp; solved it all. 
            Embedded XP booted&nbsp;like a charm.</P>
        <H3>Samples:</H3>

C:\&gt; MbrFix /drive 0 savembr Backup_MBR_0.bin

C:\&gt; MbrFix /drive 0 restorembr Backup_MBR_0.bin
You are about to Restore MBR,
are you sure (Y/N)? <b>Y</b>

C:\&gt; MbrFix /drive 0 fixmbr /yes
        </pre>
        <H3>Readstate and Writestate:</H3>
        <P>The commands <EM>readstate</EM> and <EM>writestate</EM> use a byte at offset 
            0x1b0 to store state. The commands&nbsp;are only useful in a scenario where you 
            use Windows PE to roll out other MS operating systems, and you <EM>have no other 
                place</EM> to store information about where you are in the installation 
            process. This location in the MBR is unused as far as known.
